		<h4>GROWING</h4>

		Minimal care is needed for mint. For outdoor plants, use a light mulch. This will help keep the soil moist and
		keep the leaves clean.
		For indoor plants, be sure to water them regularly to keep the soil evenly moist.
		At first, mints develop into well-behaved–looking, bushy, upright clumps, but they soon set out to conquer new
		territory with horizontal runners and underground rhizomes. Unless you block the advance, a pert peppermint
		plant can turn into a sprawling 4-foot giant in just 1 year. It’s not the stuff of horror movies, however. Mints
		benefit from picking and pruning. They are shallow-rooted and easy to pull out, so there’s no reason to worry,
		as long as you provide physical barriers such as walls, walkways, or containers.

		diet as it is full of antioxidants, vitamins, iron, and so on. In simple words, include mint in your diet if you
		want to stay healthy and happy.<br><br>
