		<h4>GROWING</h4>
		Native to India, the fast-growing curry tree is a small evergreen bush or tree that can reach anywhere from six
		to 20 feet tall. The most widely known part of the curry tree is its aromatic, spicy foliage, comprised of many
		leaflets. The leaves are pinnate and form alternately on the stem. They are best harvested when fresh.


		The tree produces fragrant white flowers, which develop into small, black fruits similar to berries. Unlike the
		leaves, they are not suitable for consumption. Curry tree is best planted in the spring.
